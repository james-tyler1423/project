# Initial Stages of CPSC 490 project

## The current files available are (1) the webscraper for the OWGR website, which acquires historical data for all tournament ranked by the owgr, and (2) the LIV golf webscraper, as this was a point of focus for the project, and the data for these tournaments are unavailbe on OWGR

Perhaps in the future, I will add more tournament data, such as amateur golf tournaments from wagr.com, but for now this is the extent of the project data collection.

## The gather_data notebook combines the first two notebooks, and cleans the data into a useable format

## The exploration notebook contains preliminary work on investigating the data; this is still a work in progress. This is a workbook, and is not in a clean state
